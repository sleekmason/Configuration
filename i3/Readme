i3wm in Lilidog is designed with a minimal amount of changes in
order to introduce new users to i3, and to provide a framework 
from which to expand and/or learn more about i3. This said, 
the current configuration should provide a fairly complete 
experience.

AUTOSTART PROGRAMS
Autostarting applications in i3 is done directly through the 
~/.config/i3/config file on or about line 35.

KEYBINDS
One of the default i3 keybinds has been changed.
'Super + e' for 'toggle split', changed to 'Super + t'

STATUSBAR
The statusbar is i3blocks, found in ~/.config/i3/i3blocks.conf.
Here, you can change items to your liking.

Some basic user keybinds are added for your convenience.
