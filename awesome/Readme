Readme for the awesome window manager in Lilidog/Beardog

Awesome in Lilidog is designed with a minimal amount of changes in
order to introduce new users to awesome, and provide a framework 
from which to expand and/or learn about awesome further. This 
being said, the current configuration should provide a fairly 
complete experience, and should be usable from the start.

AUTOSTART.SH
The autostart.sh file starts different programs from the 
~/.config/awesome folder.  It is here that you can add startup 
items as you would in any autostart file. Simply duplicate the
other lines to add your owm.

THEMES
The current theme is a modified default theme that is located
in ~/.config/awesome/themes.  This is where changes to the 
existing theme should be made. Numerous options are available.
Otherwise, to change the theme to one of the other awesome 
themes, see on or about line 60 in the ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua. 
Themes can be changed to: default, gtk, sky, xresources, zenburn.

WALLPAPERS
If the theme is to handle the wallpapers, you must comment out 
~/.fehbg in the autostart file.

WIDGITS
Wigits are the diferent items found in the topbar  These can 
be commented or uncommented starting on line 376.  Some 
adjustmet may be necessary for the weather and wifi.

KEYBINDS
User keybinds can be found starting on line 407 of the rc.lua
Two of the default awesome keybinds have been changed.
'Super + f' for 'fullscreen', changed to 'Super + Shift + f'
'Super + x' for 'run lua code' changed to 'Super + Shift + x'

Some of the basic user keybinds are added for your convenience.
